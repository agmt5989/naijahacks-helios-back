## Problem

Inadequate information on how to get physical instructors or experts
that are good at a particular course of study or enterpreneural skillset.
Tutorial centres not being able to get their target audience for their various programs and service

## Proposed Solution

A campus social system to allow for academic collaboration, particularly in preparation
for lectures, tests or other academic events, and sharing the materials received from
those 'events'. There's also potential for big data and massive value addition, 
as we allow students to include reviews and ratings for the connected items.

## Proposed Stack

Node, Express, React, Python and MongoDB, Hosted on AWS

## Benefit

- To provide a local connect among the above entities so as to
improve education in Nigeria.
- A good resource for students to find where to learn and who to learn from and also for parent to find instructors/teachers for their kids.
- Provide revenue for instructors/tutorial centers/work-space owners.
- Reduce rate of unemployment in Nigeria.
